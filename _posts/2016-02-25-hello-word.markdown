# Hi
My first public blog :).. Here I will share my thoughts about the world and what is happening around me. Right now I am doing my master's in computer science from University of Southern California. I like to teach and I am interested in machine learning. This blog will mainly contain my experiments with Machine Learning. I hope this blog will be helpful for someone who wants to learn machine learning by doing practical projects. Let's start the journey.
