# About
My first public blog :).. Here I will share my thoughts about the world and what is happening around me. I dream of a world where everyone is hopeful and no one is hungry. I don't know what to do or how to do for making that happen. But I really wanted to see that happen. I believe technology has the potential to transform peoples lives for the better. I am interested in Machine Learning, Algorithms and Math. Right now I am doing my master's in computer science at University of Southern California. This blog will mainly contains interesting things about machine learing, algorithms and Math. Let's get started.
